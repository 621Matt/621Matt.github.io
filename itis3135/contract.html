        <h2>Contract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>I, Eric M. Carter-Barkman agree to abide by the terms of the course contract
            in my Spring 2025 semester, ITIS-3135, Web-Based Application Design and Development with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. 
            I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, 
            and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
            I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, 
            failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand that given the structure and content of 
            this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. 
            I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have 
            properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates. Signed: <em>Eric M. Carter-Barkman</em>, 3/2/2025</p>
