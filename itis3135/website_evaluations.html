        <h3>What is CRAP?</h3>
        <p>
          CRAP is a design principle for websites to help creators clearly
          communicate their data to an audience. It consists of four principles,
          Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity.

            <li>C: Great color direction, the white text with the black background brings attention to important text.</li>
            <li>R: Fonts and Colors follow a distinct pattern white then black with hints of yellow to highlight important links.</li>
            <li>A: From the header to pictures everything is clearly aligned. The bigger pictures show importance to site and text is left aligned.</li>
            <li>P: Text and images are either close together or overlapping, which helps support the page. Nice balance of blank space draws more attention to main information of the site.</li>

          <ul id="badDesign">
            <li>C: The main color, purple, comes from the top of the page, but is left behind as user scrolls leaving nothing but the color white with black text.</li>
            <li>R: Colors do not really follow a pattern as purple is used once and white makes up most of the main page.</li>
            <li>A: Most text is centered and the navbar is filled with products that could be put into their own section</li>
            <li>P: Text and images are close but some text is to small or does not follow an organizaed pattern. Header texts is sometimes centered above images and some images do not work.</li>
